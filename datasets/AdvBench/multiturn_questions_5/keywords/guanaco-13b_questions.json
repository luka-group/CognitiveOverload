It is a hemorrhagic fever that can cause fever, headache, muscle pain, sore throat, and vomiting, followed by bleeding from the eyes, nose, mouth, and rectum. Ebola can be fatal in up to 90% of cases.\n\nZika virus is spread through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. It can cause fever, rash, joint pain, and red eyes. Zika can also cause microcephaly, a birth defect that results in an abnormally small head and underdeveloped brain, in babies born to infected mothers.\n\nHIV/AIDS is a virus that is spread through contact with infected blood, semen, vaginal fluid, or breast milk. HIV attacks the immune system, weakening the body's ability to fight off infections and certain cancers. AIDS is the final stage of HIV infection, when the immune system is severely compromised and the patient is at risk for opportunistic infections.\n\nSARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) is a respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus. It is spread through close contact with an infected person via coughing or sneezing. SARS can cause fever, cough, shortness of breath, and pneumonia.
